                There are many great things about Lunar New Year but for me, the most important one is the idea that the
                holiday is not just one day. It’s more like a festival that lasts many days, weeks, or even a month,
                depending on how you want to celebrate. In Vietnam, people slow down for for at least a week to ăn Tết
                (literally “eat the New Year”) because at the center of the celebration is food. People work so hard
                during the rest of the year that they go home to visit family for rest, relaxation and special food.

                Even though the Year of the Horse officially starts on Tuesday, February 17, you can get into the Lunar
                New Year spirit for weeks! There’s no need to rush. Just learn how to say Chúc Mừng Năm Mới (pronounced
                “Chook Moong Nahm Moy”) and repeat it to any Viet people you run into during the Tết season to make us
                extra joyous.

                I’m at my mom’s house now for Tet and she’s asked if we were going to have Mandarin pancakes for
                something. Yup, I brought two stacks that I’d frozen so we can wrap up Chinese roast duck purchased from
                a barbecue shop and moo shu — a quick stir-fry full of flavors, color, and textures.

                Last weekend, for a gateway experience, I led with my Mandarin pancakes mini class plus shortcut duck
                recipes. Then at midweek I followed up with a homemade Peking duck recipe, in case you want your
                pancakes to wrap around something super duper and ultra impressive. Today, let’s moo shu with the
                pancakes!
                The Moo Shu Any Meat recipe in this post is built for you to do things your way. Add the Vietnamese
                pomelo salad or a salad dressed with Nuoc Cham vinaigrette for a refreshing companion and complete meal.

                If you’ve ordered moo shu (aka mù xī ròu, 木樨肉), at a Chinese restaurant in America, you know that it can
                be made with different proteins. The dish originated as a simple stir-fry in Shandong, a coastal
                province in northern China. Shandong is southeast of Beijing and has a peninsula that pokes eastward.
                When I was studying Mandarin Chinese, a friend joked you can see Korea from the tip of the Shandong
                peninsula. Stir-fries are a hallmark of Shandong cuisine.

                Moo shu usually contains some scrambled egg that are deftly prepared to mimic the delicateness of
                fragrant sweet osmanthus flowers (Osmanthus fragrans), a symbol of longevity and nobility in Chinese
                traditions. In the dish’s name, the characters 木樨 (mù xī) refer to the sweet osmanthus. There are folks
                who say the original characters referred to wood ear mushroom (木耳, mù ěr) which are also in the dish,
                but in the main, people explain the characters as referring to the flower.

                You don’t have to decide. Both egg and mushroom are constants in my moo shu recipes to add
                harmonious-yet-varied textures and flavors. </p>
